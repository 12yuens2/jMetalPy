## PEP8!

It is really important to follow some standards when a team develops an application. If all team members format the code in the same format, then it is much easier to read the code. PEP8 is Python's style guide. It's a set of rules for how to format your Python code.

Some style rules:

  - Package and module names: <br/>
Modules should have short, **all-lowercase** names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, **all-lowercase** names, although the use of underscores is discouraged. In Python, a module is a file with the suffix '.py'.

  - Class names: <br/>
Class names should normally use the **CapWords** convention. 

  - Method names and instance variables: <br/>
**Lowercase with words separated by underscores** as necessary to improve readability. 

There are many more style standards in PEP8! &nbsp; &rarr; [PEP8 documentation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008). </br>
The most appropriate is to use an IDE that has support for PEP8. For example, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
